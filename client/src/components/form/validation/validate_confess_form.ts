ğŸ’¡ 	Our validation functions are composed of an array of smaller validation rules.
	
	This way we only have to write the actual logic ONCE. See `validation_rules.ts` and `validation_rules.test.ts`

	With this design, it's easy to visually see that the code matches the spec for each input.

	This design also allows us to easily change the associated constants or mix/match rules on
	future components - each time we add a new rule, all inputs become more powerful
	as they can opt into using that rule.
